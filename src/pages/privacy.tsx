          note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us
          and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have
          supplied us with is right.

          You may also ask us to erase personal data that we control if you do
          not believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard
          of this right described as the &quot;right to be forgotten”). Although
          we will do everything to respect your request and personal data it may
          not always be possible to erase all of your personal data as there may
          be legal requirements to keep certain personal data or technical
          limitations to the data we can delete; for example, we are not able to
          satisfy requests to erase records and information recorded on the
          blockchain, including, but not limited to, your chosen user name, your
          transaction history and your account balance.

          There may also be legitimate interests in keeping certain data. If
          this is the case we will continue to process this data.

          If erasure is not technically possible or we believe that we have a
          good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us
          to erase we will tell you this and our reasoning at the time we
          respond to your request.

        <p className="my-4">
          You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the
          contact details set out here and telling us that you are making a
          request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what
          basis you are making that request. If you want us to replace
          inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new data
          is. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of
          request.

          interest you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way

          rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are
          not valid.

          data’s accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the
          data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no
          longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose

          time we first respond to your request or after we have had the
          opportunity to consider and investigate it.
